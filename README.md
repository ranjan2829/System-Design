# System Design Learning Path for SDE 1 ‚Üí SDE 2 Promotion

## üéØ Learning Objectives
This repository contains a comprehensive learning path for system design concepts essential for SDE 1 to SDE 2 level promotion. The curriculum is structured to build foundational knowledge and practical skills through hands-on projects.

## üöÄ **Core System Design Concepts to Master**

### **1. Load Balancing**
**What it is**: Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers
**Why it matters**: Prevents server overload, improves performance, ensures high availability
**Key Algorithms**:
- Round Robin: Distribute requests evenly
- Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
- Weighted Round Robin: Distribute based on server capacity
- IP Hash: Route based on client IP for session affinity

**Code Example**:
```nginx
upstream backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:8001;
    server 127.0.0.1:8002;
    server 127.0.0.1:8003;
}
```

### **2. Caching Strategies**
**What it is**: Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage
**Why it matters**: Reduces database load, improves response times, saves costs
**Types**:
- Application Cache: In-memory storage
- Database Cache: Query result caching
- CDN: Global content distribution
- Session Cache: User session data

**Code Example**:
```python
# Redis caching
cached_user = redis_client.get(f"user:{user_id}")
if cached_user:
    return json.loads(cached_user)
```

### **3. Database Connection Pooling**
**What it is**: Reusing database connections instead of creating new ones
**Why it matters**: Reduces connection overhead, improves performance, prevents connection exhaustion
**Benefits**:
- Faster response times
- Resource efficiency
- Better scalability
- Connection management

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20, // Maximum connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
});
```

### **4. Rate Limiting**
**What it is**: Controlling the number of requests a client can make
**Why it matters**: Prevents abuse, protects resources, ensures fair usage
**Strategies**:
- Token bucket: Allow bursts up to a limit
- Sliding window: Track requests over time
- Fixed window: Count requests in time periods
- Leaky bucket: Smooth out request bursts

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // 100 requests per window
});
```

### **5. Database Indexing**
**What it is**: Creating data structures to speed up database queries
**Why it matters**: Faster query execution, better performance, reduced resource usage
**Types**:
- Primary Index: Unique identifier
- Secondary Index: Non-primary columns
- Composite Index: Multiple columns
- Partial Index: Subset of data

**Code Example**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_status_created ON users(status, created_at);
```

### **6. Microservices Communication**
**What it is**: Services communicating with each other in distributed systems
**Why it matters**: Scalability, fault isolation, technology diversity
**Patterns**:
- Synchronous: HTTP/REST, gRPC
- Asynchronous: Message queues, event streaming
- Service Discovery: Finding services automatically
- Circuit Breaker: Fault tolerance

**Code Example**:
```go
client := pb.NewUserServiceClient(conn)
resp, err := client.GetUser(context.Background(), &pb.UserRequest{Id: userID})
```

### **7. Message Queues**
**What it is**: Asynchronous communication between services
**Why it matters**: Decoupling services, reliability, scalability
**Use Cases**:
- Background processing
- Event-driven architecture
- Data synchronization
- Workflow orchestration

**Code Example**:
```python
# Producer
channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='task_queue', body=message)

# Consumer
def process_message(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f"Received: {body}")
```
